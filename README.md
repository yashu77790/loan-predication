# loan-predication
we predict here the loan for a particular person to be given or not
first we have to download the train and test csv datasets .
secondly go thnrough the ipynb files to check out the coding part for implemention.
A project which uses machine learning to check if the person is more likely to recieve the Loan that he/she receives, 
We trained our model on variety of dataset showing different kind of people with various status and likeness 
then return the Loan and our model understood the pattern of the Data on which we have used it to build a simple webapp with flask to show the process.
